    <p class="navy" style="padding:3% 4%;background-color:#da70d6;">I think you know me well.  But do you know about my qualities?  Woohoo Google says I have high protein.  Yes I help people get dietary fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, folate, magnesium.  potassium, and iron.  Bapreee when I looked up my ingredients on google, I fainted for 3 hours ðŸ˜†ðŸ¤£.  Anyway if you take me everyday you will definitely get extra speed in your body like maglev train speed.  But don't forget to soak me overnight before taking me in the morning.  Pay no attention to my color, just pay attention to my qualities.  Because you know flour is white in color but food made from flour is very unhealthy but delicious.  Just take me everyday and be a superhero.  bye bye... </p>
