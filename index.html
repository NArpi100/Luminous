  <h3 style="padding:5% 8%; padding:5% 4%;">Apart from my studies, I also have a great interest in Nutrition.  Actually I think I am a daughter of Nature.  When I saw any health problem in my family and neighborhood, it used to hurt my heart.  Because if a human was good yesterday.So what happened today or what is the cause of his or her illness or what natural thing can fill this deficiency...etc.  I am not a doctor but I would like to find some supernatural resources that are abundant in nature. Which Keeps the human body healthy and happy internally.  Actually it makes me happy when I see people stay healthy in old age, I don't know why.  Actually our precious good health is a result of what we did in our childhood or at a young age.  So I found out the main components which are most essential for our body and we need to consume them on a daily basis to get better result in our health. And these components or Nutrients are very common and we can easily get them everywhere but most people ignore these foods  So I will introduce 3 simple foods that contains these most important Nutrients.</h3>

Yes, in human body I exist approx 70% in their internal space. They have to understand without me no life and no energy.

Yes I help people to get dietary fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, folate, magnesium.  potassium, and iron.

While this was happening, I told a friend of mine that if you feel a little pain, then look at me and smile.  This boy felt little pain while taking this injection.  Yesss he gave this sweet smile.  so what does that mean???  It means whatever situation comes your way, accept it, put on your sweet smile and pretend that you are strong enough to fight them.  But situations come and go, but it's totally up to you.  As an example when the airplane takes off, the energy is provided by the engines, where Chemical energy is being converted into Mechanical energy.  It provides thrust to increase the speed of the airplane to take off.  So to fly you have to change in different aspects but your aim should be right.  So be strong like this boy and move ahead with a lovely smile...   </h5>

      <p>I hope you enjoyed visiting this website.  If any of the content hurt you or made you sad or angry then I am so sorry my one and only true Ami.  I have implemented some web development tools to wish you a happy birthday.  It might be weird or stupid but it was my way because I can't see you..I can't hear you.. so it's the only way to reach you.  I used to build this website every day when I got free time in office.  Sometimes I used to do this while returning from office to PG just after dinner.  Do you know recently I got promotion for good performance in my office.  Only 16 people got this promotion so the stipend is just around the corner and it will also be increased.  I gave some delicious food to my first love my parents because it was my first stipend.  And I want to give you a treat too.  I hope to get that opportunity one day.Once again Happy Birthday Navin🎁</p>
